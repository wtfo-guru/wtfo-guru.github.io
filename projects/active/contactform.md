### Contact Form

As in most cases there are always more than one way to "skin a cat". I will try
to keep this updated with information on my progress.

1. [Attempt Numero Uno](https://dev.to/charalambosioannou/create-a-static-webpage-with-a-contact-form-on-github-pages-3532)

	This proved workable, but without a paid account on [Formspree](https://formspree.io/plans) you cannot specify a return url.

2. [Attempt Numero Dos](https://gitlab.com/just-code/just_contact_backend)

	Although this open source free project should fullfill my needs better than Formspree, as is it would required a cloud instance configured with a webserver and php. While that would be half the cost of Formspree, I would rather attempt to modify the project to support [dokku](https://dokku.com/).
	
	I am trying [this](https://www.broculos.net/2015/12/dokku-how-to-deploy-vanilla-php.html) howto in my first conversion attempt.
